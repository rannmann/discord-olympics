This repo is an early WIP.

# Features

## Daily announcement

I want to show the timestamps of when each important game will start in the user's timestamp (using tags, like `<t:1543392060:t>`).  I want it broken into 3 sections:

1. Medaling events (bronze/silver/gold).
2. A list of all sports being played that day
3. Other Team USA games (that are not already covered in the medaling section).

## Live feed

I want a new message to be posted by the bot anytime a new event starts.  It should say the sport and the event name at minimum.  If there is team/player information, I would like that included as well.  This should be a short message since it's likely to be spammy.

## Medal Counter

I want a command that returns the current medal count only to the user who requested it, so we don't spoil it for anyone not watching live.
